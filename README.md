Library that can be used in any NBA related Python Programs.  

It uses web scraping to get the players stats.  

Ex.  
player = Player("James Harden")  
player.GetStats() # Will return all of the players stats of all of his years in the NBA  
player.GetName() # Will return Player's name  
player.GetAge() # Will return Player's age  
player.GetHighestPPG() # Will return the highest ppg of the player throughout his years in the NBA, and will return the year along with it  
etc.
